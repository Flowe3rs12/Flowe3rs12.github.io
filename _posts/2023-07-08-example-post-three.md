In a realm where dreams and stardust blend,
There walks an idol, a rose-hued trend,
A vision in pink, a jacket aglow,
Capturing hearts wherever they go.

With every step, a rhythm ignites,
Their presence a symphony of dazzling lights,
In a pink jacket that blooms like spring,
They dance and sing, an enchanting thing.

Like petals unfurling in dawn's embrace,
They charm the world with elegance and grace,
Their voice, a melody that heaven sends,
Guiding us through life's twists and bends.

Oh, idol in pink, you shine so bright,
A beacon of hope in the darkest night,
With each twirl and sway, you mesmerize,
Weaving magic before our very eyes.

A jacket of pink, a symbol of flair,
A reminder to dream, to do and dare,
You inspire us all to reach for the skies,
With your radiant spirit that never denies.

So here's to the idol who wears pink so well,
In their presence, our hearts forever swell,
May their journey be filled with love and glee,
An icon of joy for all to see.
